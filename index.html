        <h3>A timeline of Coach Snyder's career at Kansas State.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>1989</b> - marks the first year of Snyder's career at Kansas State and the beginning of <i>"The greatest turnaround in college football history!"</i> Previously Kansas State was plaqued with an miserable 0-21 record in the previous two seasons, as well as having multiple losing season over several decades. Coach Snyder had a big job on his hands to turn the program around and even save it from being dropped into a division 2 program.</li>
            <li><b>1991</b> - The first winning season under Snyder, when he led the team to a 7-4 record. This was just their second winning season since 1982. This first winning season in over 10 years marks the fruit of all the blood, sweat and tears Coach Snyder and his teams endured, but more importantly give WildCat nation the much needed hope they have been looking for.</li>
            <li><b>1993</b> - Marks the Cat's and Coach Snyders first bowl together when they beat Wyoming 52-17 in the Copper Bowl. From then on until 2003, K-State would have 11 consecutive bowl game appearances under Snyder, winning six.</li>
            <li><b>1998</b> - A huge milestone for K-State's miraculous turnaround as the hit number 1 in the coaches poll for the first time ever in program history. Unfortunately they will lose to Texas A&M in the Big VII championship and miss out on their first ever national championship apparence. </li>
            <li><b>2003</b> - One of the biggest upsets in college football happened when Coach Snyder and the WildCat's took down the top ranked Oklahoma Sooners in the Big VII championship. Bob Stoops (who coached under Snyder for mutliple season in the mid 90's) and the OU Sooners where bested in this game in a blow out fashion and gave Manhattan their first ever Big VII Championship </li>
            <li><b>2005</b> - Coach Snyder announces his retirement, but this isn't the end for Snyder and Manhattan.</li>
            <li><b>2009 to present</b> - Since returning to the coaching sidelines for the 2009 season, Snyder has coached K-State to eight straight bowl game appearances. Over 26 years, he has amassed 209 wins, more than any other coach during the Big 12 era.</li>
        </ul>

            <p>Throughout his head coaching career, Coach Snyder has instilled his 16 goals as his blueprint for success both on and off the field. These goals include: commitment, unselfishness, unity, improve, be tough, self-discipline, great effort, enthusiasm, eliminate mistakes, never give up, don’t accept losing, no self-limitations, expect to win, consistency, leadership and responsibility.</p> 
            <p>As Snyder has said on multiple occasions, “We came to Kansas State because of the people, stayed because of the people, and returned because of the people, and that remains unchanged.”</p> 
            <p>When Coach Snyder accepted this job and took on the task of rebuilding this program, he had one goal in mind. His famous line of, “I think the opportunity for the greatest turnaround in college football exists here today, and it’s not one to be taken lightly,” was just a foretaste of what was yet to come.</p>
